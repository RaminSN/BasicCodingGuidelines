# Basic Coding Guidelines
This repository contains guidelines for writing more readable and maintainable software. Concepts are universal but examples are in C#. 

The aim is not to establish arbitrary conventions for code uniformity (i.e. readability by familiarity). That is something
each team of developers can establish for themselves easily. Rather, the focus is on documenting ways of coding that are objectively clearer 
and less error-prone. 

Lack of familiarity with a certain way of writing code is not considered valid criticism; familiarity can be easily acquired. The previous statement
notwithstanding, these guidelines are aimed toward and tailored for teams writing code in a non-functional paradigm, such as object-oriented or
or basic procedural programming. For functional programmers this set of guidelines serve no purpose; the functional paradigm itself encompasses
these teachings on a more advanced level.

If you have disagreements, questions, ideas, feedback, or other thoughts you would like to voice, feel free to create an issue or comment on other
open issues.
